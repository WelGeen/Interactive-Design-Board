# Interactive-Design-Board
This project focuses on designing an interactive design board that generates creative visual animations.

### Objectives
- Encourage students to explore the possibilities of animated posters and how a physical "design board" can function.
- Teach students how to write short scripts to control visuals, filters, and animations.

### Practical Details
- A mobile prototype of the "design board" is available as inspiration: [CSS Poster Prototype](https://welgeen.nl/css-poster/)
- Requirements: A physical design board and project documentation.

## Assignments
Each assignment starts with a sketching phase on paper at our WELGEEN design studio. After sketching, students will dive into JavaScript coding to create small proofs of concept. The ultimate goal is to develop a physical design board with various buttons, similar to a soundboard.

### 1. Random Animation Generator
- Sketch a system where pressing a button triggers a random animation.
- Implement JavaScript code to generate animations randomly.

### 2. Music-Responsive Visuals
- Sketch how animations can react to sound.
- Use Web Audio API to analyze sound and generate visuals accordingly.

### 3. Interactive Filters
- Sketch how different filters can be applied to an animation.
- Write JavaScript to allow users to switch between filters dynamically.

### 4. Motion-Controlled Effects
- Sketch how hand gestures can control animations.
- Implement basic motion detection using JavaScript and MediaPipe.

### 5. Sequential Storytelling
- Sketch a short story that unfolds through animations.
- Code the animations to be triggered in a sequence.

### 6. Data-Driven Visuals
- Sketch how external data (e.g., weather, time) can influence animations.
- Fetch real-time data and use it to generate visual effects.

### 7. Touch-Responsive Animations
- Sketch a design where touch interactions change the animation.
- Implement touch event listeners in JavaScript.

### 8. Typography in Motion
- Sketch an animated typography layout.
- Create animated text effects using CSS and JavaScript.

### 9. Collaborative Visuals
- Sketch a multi-user interactive experience.
- Use WebSockets or Firebase to create a collaborative visual board.

### 10. Pattern Generator
- Sketch a system that generates random patterns.
- Code a script that generates and animates unique patterns.

## Future Goals
The ultimate vision is to create a real, physical design board with multiple buttons, allowing users to trigger different animations and visuals in an intuitive and engaging way.

## Get Started
1. Start with sketches on paper.
2. Experiment with JavaScript and small proofs of concept.
3. Share your results and collaborate with others.

Happy coding!
